# ws-cljs

WebSocket & ClojureScript repository.

## Getting it up and running

### Prerequisites

ClojureScript with closure-library from SVN HEAD.
You can get it from my clone of ClojureScript for now: https://github.com/neotyk/clojurescript/tree/35-cl-head
Than you bootstrap cljs with ./script/bootstrap --closure-library-head
You can also vote on http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJS-35 if you would like process of getting HEAD version
closure-library be easier.

Compass if you intend to change styles.

Clone the ws-cljs repo: https://github.com/neotyk/ws-cljs

### Building

It's quite easy: ./build.sh for production build and ./build-dev.sh for development build.
To run it: lein run, can't get any simplier
Production set: http://localhost:8108/index-dev.html
Development set: http://localhost:8108/index.html
